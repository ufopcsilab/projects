Find below some general guidelines for our students:
- **Planning**: Effective planning is crucial. Create a comprehensive schedule with attainable goals and maintain it in a spreadsheet format. Maintain open communication with your supervisor through regular meetings, ideally on a weekly basis. Your supervisor may oversee multiple students, so it is imperative that you keep your progress updated. If needed, reach out to your supervisor via email or a personal visit to ensure the progress of your schedule is well-monitored.
 - **Git**: Before everything, create a git project named 'FirstNameLastName' with 2 folders: 'code' (for your code), and 'thesis' (for your latex files). We also encourage everyone to use [overleaf](overleaf.com) for writing. If possible, sync overleaf with the git repository. Keep everything in your git repository up to date. 
 - **Experiment tracking**: Organize your git repository. We strongly recommend using an experiment tracking tool such as [MLFlow](https://mlflow.org/docs/latest/tracking.html) and [WandB](https://docs.wandb.ai/quickstart?utm_source=twitter&utm_medium=social&utm_campaign=sponsorship&utm_term=mark-teneholtz). Read this great [MLFlow tutorial](https://blog.devgenius.io/mlflow-an-extended-hello-world-99739b68bf29) by Felipe Melo or if you prefer run this [WandB example](https://colab.research.google.com/github/wandb/examples/blob/master/colabs/intro/Intro_to_Weights_%26_Biases.ipynb) for a nice Dashboard for your experiments.  Also, take time to read this [guideline](https://coderefinery.github.io/reproducible-research/organizing-projects/) to help you organize your directories and experiments. Example of how to organize your git repository: [link](https://github.com/csleemooo/Deep_learning_based_on_parameterized_physical_forward_model_for_adaptive_holographic_imaging).
 - **CSILab servers and GPUs**: We have nice computers in our laboratory (128Gb RAM, >40 cores), with powerful GPUS (RTX 3090, etc), available for you to run your experiments (don't stress your laptop!!). Access to the lab machines is done remotely and managed by Prof. Pedro Silva (silvap@ufop.edu.br). Drop an email to Prof. Pedro (with a copy to your supervisor) for instructions on how to use our infra-structure.
 - **Be an active member of the lab**: Participate, use our physical space, meet other students and the professors. Live the lab! The exchange of knowledge is very important! Ask your supervisor to add you to the Lab's WhatsApp and Slack groups.
 - **Working with Deep Learning**: Training deep learning models is a difficult task. Finding good hyperparameters and architectures can be a tricky activity for beginners. If your model does not converge or is performing poorly, before going to your supervisor, take a look at the tutorials: [Deep Learning Tuning Playbook](https://github.com/google-research/tuning_playbook), and [A Recipe for Training Neural Networks](http://karpathy.github.io/2019/04/25/recipe/). Mandatory reading: [How to avoid machine learning pitfalls:
a guide for academic researchers](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2108.02497.pdf).
 - **Don't reinvent the wheel!** Start from good code repositories. Get to know [PaperWithCode](https://paperswithcode.com/).
 - **How to write good papers**: As a researcher or scientist, writing is a critical component of your work. To aid in this endeavor, we highly recommend following the [guidelines](https://jvgemert.github.io/writing.pdf) set forth by Professor Jan Van Gemert. Our laboratory places great emphasis on adhering to these [guidelines](https://jvgemert.github.io/writing.pdf) for all research papers, dissertations, and theses. It is recommended to thoroughly review these guidelines multiple times for optimal results. Additionally, familiarizing oneself with well-written papers is essential to hone your writing skills. We suggest regularly reading high-quality research papers to gain insights and improve your writing style ([well-written paper](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2305.12596.pdf)). For further reference, we also recommend the article "[Heuristics for Scientific Writing (a Machine Learning Perspective)](https://www.approximatelycorrect.com/2018/01/29/heuristics-technical-scientific-writing-machine-learning-perspective/)" as a useful resource in enhancing your writing abilities. A good tool for help with the literature review is [Litmap](https://app.litmaps.com/).
 - **Use a template to start you paper**: The Prof. Jan Van Gemert also has a great [skeleton guidelines](https://jvgemert.github.io/paper_skeleton.rtf) on how to write a paper. Here is an [example of an  article skeleton](https://jvgemert.github.io/paper_skeleton_example_CVPR20.rtf) from Prof. Gemert.
 
 - **Stuck?** Meet your supervisor more often! We encourage you to engage in regular and open communication with your supervisor. Our goal is to assist you in every way possible, and regular meetings can help facilitate this support.
 - **For PPGCC students**: Get to know the program's [regiment](http://www3.decom.ufop.br/pos/resolucoes/) and maintain open communication with your student representative. Ultimately, it is your responsibility to manage and stay informed about your academic progress. Follow the [PPGCC](http://www3.decom.ufop.br/pos/inicio/) website and the social media.
 - **For undergrad students**: Pay attention to IC deadlines and check the [PROPPI website](https://propp.ufop.br/pt-br/pesquisa/iniciacao-cientifica) frequently.
 - **PPGCC/UFOP template** for your [TCC](), [Thesis]() and [Dissertation]().
