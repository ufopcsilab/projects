1) **Front-end for the TSAPI and the generation/analysis of functional networks**
> Professor: Vander L. S. Freitas
>
> The former student involved: Vinicius Silva (http://www.monografias.ufop.br/handle/35400000/4934) 
>
> Description: The TSAPI is a distributed API designed to compare sets of time series and produce similarity matrices as output. In this project, we aim to create a front-end interface that can consume the TSAPI and generate functional networks from the produced similarity matrices. Additionally, we will analyze the networks and display plots that visualize the metrics and distributions.

2) **Assess similarity metrics/algorithms for time series concerning different kinds of series (chaotic, periodic, chaotic+periodic, noisy)**
> Professor: Vander L. S. Freitas
> 
> Students: Iuri Diniz, Vinicius Silva
> 
> Description: The generation of functional networks, as described by [(Ferreira et al., 2021)](https://doi.org/10.1140/epjs/s11734-021-00274-y), is an interesting research topic. These networks are formed from nodes that are connected when their properties or attributes are similar. However, a critical challenge in this area is to identify a suitable similarity metric or algorithm, which can be difficult depending on the type of data being compared. Therefore, this project aims to compare various types of temporal series (including chaotic, periodic, chaotic+periodic, noisy, and both real and synthetic data) and evaluate different similarity metrics and algorithms for constructing functional networks. 

3) **Generating and storing temporal collaboration networks**
> Professor: Vander L. S. Freitas
>
> Description: [OpenAlex](https://openalex.org/) is a comprehensive and open catalog of scholarly papers, authors, and institutions. Our objective is qury the database and create temporal networks in standard formats. Currently, there is an API (https://github.com/filipinascimento/openalexnet) available to generate static networks, which could be adapted to the temporal context.

4) **Community detection in temporal networks**
> Professor: Vander L. S. Freitas
> 
> Description: The objective of this project is to implement and compare different community detection algorithms for temporal networks. The [OpenAlex](https://openalex.org/) dataset could serve as a case study for this investigation.

5) **Robustness analysis in oscillator networks**
> Professor: Vander L. S. Freitas
> 
> Previous students: Vinicius Fonseca, Suleimane Ducure, Douglas Barbosa
> 
> Description: The aim is to seek attack strategies that best destroy or keep synchronization. 
> 
> Literature: [Barabasi (2016)](http://networksciencebook.com/chapter/8), [Strogatz and Stewart (1993)](https://www.jstor.org/stable/24941731), [Mallada and Tang (2013)](https://doi.org/10.1088/1751-8113/46/50/505101).

6) **Simulation of spreading models on top of networks**
> Professor: Vander L. S. Freitas
> 
> Students: Gabriel F. da Costa
> 
> Description: Our focus is on simulating spreading models on networks, and there are several options for choosing the model. One possibility is to simulate a metapopulation on each node, or to use contact networks where each node represents an individual. Additionally, we're interested in exploring the development of platforms to facilitate this work. For instance, we could create a website that allows users to upload their own network, select a specific model, simulate it, and visualize/download the results. Another option is to develop a [NetLogo](https://ccl.northwestern.edu/netlogo/) project that can run the model on both synthetic and real networks. Finally, we're also interested in implementing spreading models on multilayer and temporal networks. We are interested in simulating spreading models on top of networks.

7) **Development of a QGIS add-on to generate road networks from shape files**
> Professor: Vander L. S. Freitas
> 
> Description: The objective of this project is to develop a QGIS add-on that can take a shapefile containing road data for a particular region as input and generate a corresponding road network. The resulting network will feature roads as nodes, and connections between these nodes will be created wherever pairs of roads intersect.

8) **Investigate which transport modes were more important during the COVID-19 pandemic** 
> Professor: Vander L. S. Freitas
> 
> Students: Suleimane Ducure
> 
> Description: This project aims to establish a correlation between the structure of mobility networks and the spread of COVID-19. Our hypothesis is that the transportation network can significantly influence the path of the disease, which has been confirmed for the terrestrial mode under certain conditions, as noted by [(Freitas et al, 2020)](http://dx.doi.org/10.1590/0102-311X00184820). However, we seek to determine the role of each transport mode in the spread of the pandemic during different phases.


9) **Characterize mobility networks from different countries, in different scales and topologies (temporal, multilayer)**
> Professor: Vander L. S. Freitas
> 
> Students: Diogo Nascimento
> 
> Description: We aim to create a comprehensive dataset of mobility networks from different regions of the world, encompassing various resolutions (intra-city, inter-city) and types (static, temporal, weighted, multilayer, etc.). The datasets will be downloaded, and the corresponding networks will be generated and stored in a consistent format. Descriptive statistics will be extracted from the networks, and a comparative analysis will be conducted to produce a survey of the different mobility networks. All data and code will be made publicly available, facilitating further research in this field.

A good representation of solutions in the decision space is also important from the point of view of the decision-making process. See this [paper](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/9037034).


## Machine Learning / Deep Learning <a name="machine-learning"></a>
1) **Automatic Classification of Arrhythmias: Approach Based on Temporal Vectorcardiogram and Graph Neural Networks** 
> Professors: Eduardo J. S. Luz and Vander L. S. Freitas
> 
> Students: Rafael Oliveira, Guilherme L. Silva, Gabriel Garcia, VinÃ­cius Queiroz
> 
> Description: In this project, we propose the classification of heartbeats through graph neural networks in order to extract features simultaneously from two ECG leads plus one temporal component. The premise is that by relating two ECG derivatives in time, new information can be detected and thus enhance the extraction of a more robust feature vector. Additionally, we aim to investigate ways of reducing computational and memory cost, in order to facilitate integration with medical equipment through hardware accelerators.
> 
> Results: In previous works, we investigated the impact of considering more than one ECG lead on arrhythmia classification [article 1](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/abstract/document/7319564), and we even proposed a new representation of a heartbeat with three dimensions, which we called the temporal vectorcardiogram (TVCG) [article 2](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-017-09837-3). We explored complex network techniques to extract features and performed table classification. In current work, we are exploring feature extraction directly from raw data through graph neural networks [article 3](https://sol.sbc.org.br/index.php/sbcas/article/download/21630/21454/), [article 4](https://sol.sbc.org.br/index.php/sbcas/article/download/21630/21454/). Currently, we are exploring the techniques on two databases, the MITDB and the database explored in [article 5](https://sol.sbc.org.br/index.php/sbcas/article/download/21616/21440). The most current code, maintained by the Master's student Rafael Oliveira, can be found at [link]. For a good understanding of the problem, we recommend reading our survey at [link](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0169260715003314).
> 
> Work to be done: Current results show that the approach via Graph Convolutional Network (GCN) is promising [article 3, article 4], however, there is still much to be done to make it feasible for clinical use, especially in terms of computational cost. Currently, we need (1) to find/develop more efficient implementations of the visibility graph technique (used to transform a heartbeat into a graph) and (2) to employ the visibility graph on two ECG derivatives at the same time (visibility graph in 2 dimensions). Another research path is (3) to study other ways of mapping a heartbeat (which is a one-dimensional signal) into a graph.

2) **Automatic Classification of Arrhythmias: Approach Based on Self-Supervised Learning** 
> Professors: Eduardo J. S. Luz, Pedro H. L. Silva 
> 
> Students: Guilherme L. Silva
> 
> Description: In this project, we propose the classification of heartbeats using deep learning (convolutional and recurrent networks, attention mechanism) and self-supervised learning. We believe that to make the use of such models more feasible in the field (considering the generalization aspect), self-supervised learning along with the human in the loop could be the right path. 
> 
> Results: So far, we have presented a new pretext task for ECG. Guilherme Silva (MSc candidate), achieved promising results with that pretext task and his thesis will be published soon. For a good understanding of the problem, we recommend reading the survey at [link](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0169260715003314).
> 
> Work to be done: (1) Investigate aspects of fairness and unbalance (see [article](https://arxiv.org/abs/2206.02792)), (2) Investigate aspects of uncertainty and impact of distribution shift ([article1](https://openaccess.thecvf.com/content_CVPRW_2020/papers/w42/Combalia_Uncertainty_Estimation_in_Deep_Neural_Networks_for_Dermoscopic_Image_Classification_CVPRW_2020_paper.pdf), [article2](https://openreview.net/pdf?id=LK8bvVSw6rn), [article3](https://vitalab.github.io/blog/2021/06/17/uncertainty.html), [article4](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2206.08871.pdf)), (3) Evaluate computational cost and hardware acceleration (perhaps via FPGA?), Investigate energy-based representation methods, (4) we believe there is room for a survey regarding explainability such as presented in this [paper](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/367881677_A_Short_Survey_on_Machine_Learning_Explainability_An_Application_to_Periocular_Recognition).

## Data Science <a name="data-science"></a>
1) **Pattern recognition and machine learning techniques applied to financial problems**
> Professors: Eduardo Luz and Gladston Moreira

>Students: Marcus Almeira, Mariana Mota, Luisa Cizilio, Andressa Souza

>Description: All financial institutions are adapting to function almost exclusively online. However, the ease of opening digital accounts has brought enormous challenges to the sector. One of the challenges is the ease with which customers move between banks and financial companies, making retention difficult. The ease of opening accounts has also led to an increase in cases of account creation used for fraud. And the uncontrolled explosion in the increase of customers makes credit management virtually impossible to be done manually. In order to assist financial analysts, some form of automation is mandatory. Solutions based on artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning (ML) techniques, especially artificial neural network models, are powerful tools when there is a good volume of historical data. The project aims to study and develop AI and ML models for fraud detection, credit analysis and customer management.

>Results: This research came from a partnership between the PPGCC/UFOP and Gerencianet (now EfÃ­). See preliminary results in [paper 1](https://sol.sbc.org.br/index.php/eniac/article/download/22791/22614/) and [paper 2](https://sol.sbc.org.br/index.php/eniac/article/download/22772/22595).
