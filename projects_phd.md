## Network science / Complex networks / Complex systems <a name="networks"></a>



## Multiobjective optimization <a name="moo"></a>

1) **Multi-objective Problem: Guiding under uniformity measure in the decision space**

> Professor: Gladston Moreira

> Student: Open selection process 

> Description: It aims to develop approaches for multi-objective optimization that integrate a guiding criterion to promote the uniformity of solutions in the decision variable space into the search procedure. A good representation of solutions in the decision space is also important from the point of view of the decision-making process. See this [paper](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/9037034).



## Machine Learning / Deep Learning <a name="machine-learning"></a>
1) **Plant species recognition**
> Professors: Eduardo Luz and Gladston Moreira

> Students: Pedro Castro (Ph.D. candidate)

> Description: Plant species can be recognized by their leaves, flowers, fruit, etc. The aim of this project is to investigate deep learning methods in the context of plant species recognition via images. See [Castro et al, 2022](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/abstract/document/9667141/) for more information. Dataset available within [Castro et al, 2021](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2352340921005965).


2) **Promoter prediction with deep learning**
> Professors: Eduardo Luz and Gladston Moreira

> Students: Lauro Moraes

> Description: Locating the promoter region in DNA sequences is of paramount importance in bioinformatics. This project aims to explore deep learning methods for the task. See [Morae et al, 2022](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S001048252200419X) for more information.


## Data Science <a name="data-science"></a>
1) **Pattern recognition and machine learning techniques applied to financial problems**
> Professors: Eduardo Luz and Gladston Moreira

>Students: Marcus Almeira

>Description: All financial institutions are adapting to function almost exclusively online. However, the ease of opening digital accounts has brought enormous challenges to the sector. One of the challenges is the ease with which customers move between banks and financial companies, making retention difficult. The ease of opening accounts has also led to an increase in cases of account creation used for fraud. The uncontrolled explosion in the number of customers makes credit management virtually impossible to do manually. In order to assist financial analysts, some form of automation is mandatory. Solutions based on artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning (ML) techniques, especially artificial neural network models, are powerful tools when there is a good volume of historical data. The project aims to study and develop AI and ML models for fraud detection, credit analysis, and customer management.

>Results: This research came from a partnership between the PPGCC/UFOP and Gerencianet (now Ef√≠). See preliminary results in [paper 1](https://sol.sbc.org.br/index.php/eniac/article/download/22791/22614/) and [paper 2](https://sol.sbc.org.br/index.php/eniac/article/download/22772/22595).
